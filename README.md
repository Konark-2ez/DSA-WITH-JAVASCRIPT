   # What is recursion? &#129300;
    <p> Recursion is defined as the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly until it reaches a <strong style="color:blue">base condition</strong>. The corresponding function is known as recursive function.

   # What is base condition?
     <p> Base case or condition is the condition that tells the recursive function when to stop. Absence of this will make the function run infinitely resulting into <strong style="color:red">stack overflow</strong>.
    
   # What is stack overflow?
     <p> Every time a recursive call is made the function gets stored in a stack and waits till base condition is reached but if the base condition is not reached or is absent then this function calls gets piled up resulting into memory getting full and hence resulting in stack overflow.
